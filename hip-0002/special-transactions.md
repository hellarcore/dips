## Registered transaction types

The transaction type is described based on proposed HIPs.
Here is a table of current proposed types and their associated HIP. Future HIPs
may introduce more types.

*Note:* This table refers to the _payload_ version which relates only to the special transaction
payload and is distinct from the _transaction_ version.
